Welcome to my personal blog, where I post about myself, projects I work(ed) on, and other stuff that interests me.
<!--more-->
Stay tuned in the future for new posts and in the meanwhile find out more about me [here]({% link about.markdown %}).

Here's a list of things I want to write about in the future:

* Machine Learning with Kalman Filter and DBSCAN
* Jupyter Notebook and RISE
* Reverse Engineering with radare2, Ghidra, and gdb
* Robotics
* Big Data Engineering
* Investing money/my portfolio strategy
* Healthy diet/food
* Some of my favorite books
* ..

The list goes on and there are a lot more topics I would like to write about. I hope that this year I get around to it more often.

Thanks for checking out my blog and hope to see you again soon!
