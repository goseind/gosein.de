TILs, or "Today I Learned" entries, are concise snippets with code examples designed to quickly share recent learnings. I find this approach particularly appealing for blog posts as it significantly lowers the hurdle to write and publish. While I have a backlog of ideas and drafts waiting to be completed, sometimes it's challenging to bring them to fruition. TILs offer a solution by enabling me to publish brief blog posts about things I've learned more swiftly and in a more structured manner.

I first came across this concept on [betatim's Blog](https://betatim.github.io/posts/til-explained/) and traced its origin back to [thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til).
