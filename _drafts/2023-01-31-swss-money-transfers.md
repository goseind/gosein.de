Until very recently Revolut allowed free top-ups directly from Swiss debit cards as well as through Google Pay. Then end of last year they started charging a fee for debit cards, while still allowing to use them for free through Google Pay. This has now also stopped and there is de facto no free way anymore to transfer Swiss Fanks to a European Revolut Account. Theoretically, it is still possible to transfer CHF with a regular SEPA bank transfer, but my research showed that this could lead to unwanted fees by intermediaries. In the end, I decided to go with WISE. And my money transfer process now looks like this:

Transfer money from Yuh to the WISEs swiss bank account
Use a WISE debit card to top up Revolut in CHF
Exchange money from CHF to EUR on Revolut (as before)
